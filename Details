Because the paper is over-length, there are some details in implementation which are not involved in the paper. For instance, in the pascal person part dataset, the 
LM is used for pre-processing the input images for SM. The basic function of LM is to locate the joints. The predicted skeletons are
used to describe the gestures of people. We've used the gestures to find the people in training images which have the same or similar
gestures as those in test images. The images from training data are used to simulate, or generate fake test images which have ground
truth (because training images have ground truth). In this way, the hard samples from test set can be simulated using training images\
with labels. LM significantly improves the performance of SM.
More details will be added later.
